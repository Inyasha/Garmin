# The R in Running

In celebration of having recently completed the excellent [Coursera Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science), I'm going to take a few blogs to apply some of my learnings on a hobby dataset.  The specialization teaches the basics of getting and cleaning data, exploratory data analysis, reproducibility, statistical inference, regression models, practical machine learning and developing data products.  In this blog series I'll use a similar breakdown, starting here with getting and cleaning data, exploratory data analysis and reproducibility.  I'll cheat on the reproducibility by saying that this entire blog was written in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) (this code should run for anyone with a Garmin exercise log saved within a local R Studio project folder) and available in Git.

## The Dataset

The dataset that I'll be using is from my [Garmin Forerunner 620](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2013/11/garmin-forerunner-review.html).  This is a great gadget, providing key [running metrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNCnKpLUoAw) on date, distance, calories, time, heart rate, cadence, pace, elevation, stride, vertical oscillation and ground contact time.  With [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/) runners are able to sync their watch with their online profile, share with e.g. strava.  The Garmin Connect interface, however, has a number of shortcomings in terms of exploring your data and developing insights.  A perfect use-case for R and bit of data science magic!

The specific questions that I want to address are: 

- What influences my overall fitness?  Using [VO2 Max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAN2JKpDL60) as a gauge of fitness.
- How does my running form influence my training effectiveness?  Leveraging [running dynamics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNCnKpLUoAw) to indicate running form.

For the purposes of this EDA, we'll be using Hadley Wickham's tidyverse packages and overarching model of "import - tidy - understand - communicate":

<center>

![](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/data-science.png)

</center>

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# load libraries and prerequisites
library(tidyverse)
library(ggcorrplot)
```

# Import the Data

We'll leverage the tidyverse readr package for the import.  `read_csv()` is great for comma delimited files.  It returns a useful report on the import and performs some basic assistance, for example, deduplicating duplicate column names.  In addition, it provides additional parsing assistance, using a simple  [heuristic](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html#parsing-a-file) to try and figure out the column type based on the first 1000 rows.  In most cases, it correctly interprets characters, numeric, integer and time formats.  The field types can be reviewed with the `spec()` function.  It is good practice to review `problems()` in order to ensure that all columns have been correctly parsed.  For example, we can see that the time, date fields have had problems, these were solved by setting column specifications during import.

There is a more detailed write-up of the package in Hadley Wickham's book ["R for Data Science"](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html).  

```{r import}
# import the file, overriding "TIme" upon import, otherwise it will be set to col_type Time and values lost
activities_raw <- read_csv("Activities_Master.csv", 
                           col_types = cols(
                             Date = col_datetime(format = "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M"),
                             Time = col_character(),
                             `Avg Pace` = col_time(format = "%M:%S")
                           ),
                           na = "--")

# some useful readr functions:
# spec(activities_raw) # review parsed column formats
# problems(activities_raw) # review problems during parsing
# activities_raw # review the final "tibble"

# remove spaces from field names
names(activities_raw) <- make.names(names(activities_raw))

```

## Review the Data

Once imported, we are at a point to perform some basic exploration of the dataset reviewing the dimensions, [five number summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-number_summary), mean etc.  We see that the columns after "Average Ground Contact Time" are largely blank, we can therefore remove them from future analysis.

```{r}
# some basic information (rows and columns)
dim(activities_raw)
```

```{r}
# five number summary of columns 5:10
summary(activities_raw[,5:10])
```

```{r}
# remove blank columns
activities_raw <- select(activities_raw, 1:20)
```

```{r}
# review the structure
str(activities_raw[1:5,])
```

```{r}
# let's have a look at the first 5 rows of data
head(activities_raw)

# similarly, the last 5 rows of data
tail(activities_raw)
```

```{r}
# counts - table with means?
table(activities_raw$Activity.Type) # I guess i'm not a cyclist
```


# Transform the Data

Now that we've imported our data, we will perform some basic transformation.  

One of the biggest problems with the Garmin data extract is that the `Time` field is in the format of "00:00:00", but not consistently applied as e.g. mm:ss:cc.  A run of 50 minutes, is stored as 50:00:00, whereas a run of 65 minutes is stored as 01:05:00.  For this reason, we need to store as character type, seperate and perform some `ifelse()` logic.

We perform some other, simple, transformations, including the creation of categorical variables for elevation gain and [binning](https://www.r-bloggers.com/plot-weekly-or-monthly-totals-in-r/) the `Date` into weeks and months.

Of perhaps more interest is fairly crude calculation of [VO2 Max](https://www.fetcheveryone.com/forum__58727__how_does_garmin_connect_calculate_vo2_max).  VO2 max is a measure of fitness potential.  The VO2 max is the maximum volume of oxegyn that can be consumed per minute, per kilogram of body weight, at your maximum performance.  For my age group, the typical ranges [percentiles](https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/forerunner620/EN-US/GUID-1FBCCD9E-19E1-4E4C-BD60-1793B5B97EB3.html) are 52.5+ as 95 percentile, 46.4+ as 80 percentile etc.

```{r transform, warning=FALSE}
# Separate "Time" into component parts - converting to integers
activities_tidy <- separate(activities_raw, Time, into = (c("minute", "second", "centisecond")), convert = TRUE)

# Calculate total minutes, if first character is less than 5, treat as an hour unit, else, assume it's in minutes
activities_tidy$tot_mins <- ifelse((activities_tidy$minute < 5), 
                                   activities_tidy$minute * 60 + activities_tidy$second,
                                   activities_tidy$minute)

# group elevation gain into categorical variables "high" and "low"
activities_tidy$gain <- ifelse(activities_tidy$Elev.Gain > 250, "high", "low")

# Bin the time series values to weeks and months: https://www.r-bloggers.com/plot-weekly-or-monthly-totals-in-r/
activities_tidy$week <- as.Date(cut(activities_tidy$Date, breaks = "week"))
activities_tidy$month <- as.Date(cut(activities_tidy$Date, breaks = "month"))

# Gauge
#activities_tidy$cadence_gauge <- activities_tidy %>%
#        if (`Avg Cadence` > 183) {return("purple")}

# Calculate VO2 Max per https://www.fetcheveryone.com/forum__58727__how_does_garmin_connect_calculate_vo2_max
# calculate meters per minute
activities_tidy$mpm <- (activities_tidy$Distance*1000)/activities_tidy$tot_mins
# calculate VO2
activities_tidy$vo2 <- -4.6+0.182*activities_tidy$mpm+0.000104*activities_tidy$mpm^2
# calculate % VO2 Max
activities_tidy$percentVO2 <- (activities_tidy$Avg.HR/activities_tidy$Max.HR -0.37)/0.64
# calculate VO2 Max in ml/min/kg
activities_tidy$vo2max <- activities_tidy$vo2/activities_tidy$percentVO2
```

## Missing Data

Of the `r dim(activities_tidy)[1] * dim(activities_tidy)[2]` values in the raw table, we can see that `r round(mean(is.na(activities_tidy)),2)`% are blank (NA).  Missing data is therefore not prevalent in the dataset, however, it is not random, we will see later that the pattern is significant.

```{r}
# check for blanks and n/a
# x0 <- activities_raw$Avg.Cadence
# class(x0)
# str(x0)
# summary(x0) # we can see we have some NA's
# mean(is.na(x0)) # is that missing data a problem?
# mean(is.na(activities_raw))
filter(activities_tidy, is.na(activities_tidy$Avg.Cadence_1))
```

## Outliers

Normalize and review outliers via SD.

```{r}
# outliers
# normalize VO2 Max
# standard deviation ranges
# sd(activities_tidy$vo2max)
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Now the fun starts!  We can start testing some of our hypotheses of the data.

At this point we can start to explore the dataset, missing data, outliers and categorical variables.  This exercise is best performed with the data dictionary to hand.  Here we use [Garmin's Forerunner manual](https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/forerunner620/EN-US/GUID-3F11326C-3DE8-4AF2-BC8F-8EA427E9F189.html).

## Univariate Analysis

We'll just look at single dependent variables and understand more about them.  As mentioned, we will take VO2 max as the best indicator of fitness.  

```{r univariate, message=FALSE}
summary(activities_tidy$vo2max)

# frequency distribution
activities_tidy %>%
  ggplot(aes(vo2max, color = Activity.Type)) +
  geom_freqpoly()
```

We can see that we have different activity types and that they have different VO2max.  Taking all types into account, we see that the data deviates from the normal distribution, has appreciable positive skewness and shows peakedness.  Let's filter cylcing out of our data.

```{r univariate2, message=FALSE}
# frequency distribution
activities_tidy %>%
  filter(Activity.Type != "cycling") %>%
  ggplot(aes(vo2max, y = ..density.., color = Activity.Type)) + # note: y has been set to density instead of count
  geom_freqpoly()
```

Still showing skew and peakedness, but less than previously.  Given the relatively sparse dataset (only 112 observations), we can assume much of that peakdeness would disappear with more data points.  VO2 Max would approach something similar to a normal distribution.

## Multivariate Analysis

Here we'll try to understand how the dependent and independent variables relate.  We will assess both continuous and categorical values.

### Relationship with Numerical Variables

We can see a nice linear relationiship between VO2 Max and Average Pace.  I tend to run fastest at a higher VO2 Max.  No surprises, however, given that VO2 Max is a function of meters per minute.  We're best to ignore that relationship.

```{r}
# Plot: We can see a direct relationship between Vo2Max and Average Pace - via scatterplot
activities_tidy %>%
  filter(Activity.Type != "cycling") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(Avg.Pace, vo2max)) +
#        facet_grid(. ~ `Activity Type`) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = gain)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) +
  geom_point(size = 7, colour = "black", alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_point(size = 5, colour = "red", alpha = 0.4)
#        geom_jitter() +

activities_tidy %>%
  filter(Activity.Type != "cycling") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(Avg.HR, vo2max)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

# Correlation
cor(activities_tidy$vo2max, activities_tidy$Avg.HR)

activities_tidy %>%
  filter(Activity.Type != "cycling") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(Avg.Pace, vo2max)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

We can see similar linear relationships in Average Cadence (number of steps per minute).  This aligns nicely with running dynamics philosophy that states higher cadence will generally lead to higher run performance.  

```{r}
activities_tidy %>%
  filter(Activity.Type != "cycling") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(Avg.Cadence, vo2max)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

# correlation
cor(activities_tidy$vo2max, activities_tidy$Avg.Cadence_1, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
```


Unfortunately, whilst there is a linear relationship between VO2 Max and Date, the relationship is rather flat.  This is perhaps explained by the fact that my training goes through cycles of enthusiasum and relative laziness.

```{r multinum, message=FALSE}
# Plot: Cadence over Time
activities_tidy %>%
        ggplot(mapping = aes(Date, vo2max)) +
        geom_point() +
#       legend ** for the colours
        geom_smooth()
```

```{r}
# # Plot: Time and Distance
# # ADD: mean
activities_tidy %>%
        ggplot(aes(week, tot_mins)) +
        geom_bar(color = "black", alpha=.5, size=0, show.legend = NA, stat = ("identity")) +
        geom_smooth() +
        scale_x_date(date_breaks = "3 month", date_labels = "%b %Y")
```

### Relationship with Categorical Variables

Compared with categorical variables, we can see that my VO2Max is generally higher for my training runs (track and tempo runs) and considerably lower for trail runs.  Track runs tend to have a tighter range.

```{r}
# VO2Max and Run Type
activities_tidy %>%
  filter(Activity.Type != "cycling") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Activity.Type, vo2max)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

In summary, based upon a fairly simple analysis, we can conclude that:

- VO2 Max has a fairly normal distribution.
- It has a positive linear relationship with pace, cadence and heart rate.
- Different activity types have different relationships with VO2 Max.

## And the rest of the dataset

Of the 30 or so variables, we have only analysed a handful.  These were based upon following our intuition or hypothesis, albeit based upon fairly sound research.  We shall now employ broader methods to objectively complete the feature review and selection.

We can see that the people who built the Forerunner knew what they were doing.  The running dynamics features of `Average Cadence`, `Vertical Oscillation` (the degree of bounce in running motion) and `Ground Contact Time` (how much time your foot spends on the ground) all have a tight (0.8) correlation with VO2 Max.  The former is positive with the latter two being inverse (as vertical oscillation increases, VO2 Max decreases).

```{r multivariate, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# We can use Correlogram to look at this
nums <- sapply(activities_tidy, is.numeric)
corr <- round(cor(activities_tidy[,nums], use = "pairwise.complete.obs"), 1)
ggcorrplot(corr, lab = T, lab_size = 3, method = "circle", colors = c("tomato2", "white", "springgreen3"))
```

```{r}
# scatter plot for all numeric variables
pairs(activities_tidy[,nums])
```

# Testing our Statistical Inference Assumptions

We now have a pretty good understanding of our dependent and independent variables.  Before we start on statistical inference, however, we need to test the underlying assumptions that will allow us apply multivariate techniques:

- Normality - is the data in a normal distribution?  This is important for statistical inference techniques that we'll soon use, such as t-tests.
- Homoscesdasticity - the assumptions that the dependent variable exhibits the same level of variance as the independent variables.
- Linearity - already tested for.

We saw above that the VO2 Max exhibits largely normal distribution.  We can take this further by performing a simple log transformation on the data:

```{r}
# frequency distribution
activities_tidy %>%
  filter(Activity.Type == "running") %>%
  ggplot(aes(log(vo2max), y = ..density.., color = Activity.Type)) + # note: y has been set to density instead of count
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.1)

```

# Summary

We've imported and transformed the data.  Some fairly simple exploratory data analysis has proven a few key findings:

- VO2 Max is a good measure of fitness, showing a linear relationship with Avg.Pace.
- It has a strong relationship with independent variables of Avg.Cadence, Vertical Oscillation and Average Ground Contact Time.  Less so, but still relevant with Average Stride Length.
- It meets the assumptions required to perform statistical inference and to start to make predictions.

## Save RData file

Finally, we'll save our R Data image ready for re-use during our next phase of analysis:

```{r save}
# we can also write to csv
# write_csv(activities_raw, "activities_raw.csv")

# save global environment to RData file
save.image(file = "activities.RData")

```
